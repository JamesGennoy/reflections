# Reflections: Lesson 3

## Manual vs. automatic pull
For the same reason it is beneficial to only commit manually it is also better to manual push/pull from a remote repository rather than having it done manually.

## Local copies of remote branches
Having a copy of the last known state of the remote is helpful when trying to merge any changes that come from the remote.

## Collaboration using Git and GitHub
Using GitHub would make collaborating easier. The built in tools, such as pull requests makes for a nice way to collaborate with others.

## When to use a separate branch
I would say you should always use separate branches when working in a team environment, if your project is fairly complicated, or if you want to try out an experiment and do not want to mess up the master branch. I think I will be using branches always when I am working even by myself just to have more practice at it.
